# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jarar Ahmad

ðŸ”­ Passionate about unlocking the potential of AI and decentralized intelligence. Iâ€™m building and experimenting with cutting-edge machine learning systems, custom language models, and decentralized AI protocols.

ðŸŽ“ Deeply self-driven learner focused on math, physics, and AI fundamentals â€” continuously mastering linear algebra, statistics, transformers, and quantum computing.

ðŸŒ± Currently exploring practical applications of generative AI (LLMs, Stable Diffusion, Whisper) and decentralized marketplaces like Bittensor.

ðŸ’¡ Skilled in:
- Python programming with expertise in AI/ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)  
- Building and deploying custom transformer models from scratch  
- Backend development with Django and Supabase  
- Data analysis, automation, and quantitative problem-solving  

ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborating on research, AI product development, and real-world projects that merge theory with impact.
